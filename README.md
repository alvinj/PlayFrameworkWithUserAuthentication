Sample Play Framework 2.1 App w/ User Authentication
====================================================

This is a stripped-down version of the Zentasks application that ships as a sample
with the Play Framework 2.1 distribution. I've put this code here so I can quickly
create a new Play Framework application with user authentication built in.

To be clear, this is not my code, it's just a stripped-down version of the
Zentasks sample application. But, if you want to get started with a Play application
that requires user authentication, this can be a starting point for you.
